Project Title 
**File Encryption and Decryption Utility**  

---

#### **2. Overview/Introduction**  
This project provides a Java-based utility for encrypting and decrypting files securely using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. It ensures robust security through salted key derivation and a multi-threaded processing mechanism for handling multiple files efficiently.  

---

#### **3. Features**  
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses AES with CBC mode for secure file encryption and decryption.  
- **Key Derivation**: Derives a strong cryptographic key from a password and a unique salt.  
- **Multi-Threaded Processing**: Supports parallel encryption and decryption of multiple files for enhanced performance.  
- **IV Management**: Handles initialization vector (IV) storage and retrieval for secure encryption operations.  

---

#### **4. Prerequisites**  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.  
- Basic knowledge of file systems and cryptography (optional).  

---

#### **5. Installation and Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
2. Ensure the necessary JDK is installed on your system.  
3. Compile the code using `javac Main.java`.  
4. Run the program using `java Main`.  

---

#### **6. Usage**  
- Place the input file (`example.txt`) in the specified directory.  
- Configure the file paths and password in the `Main` class.  
- The program will:  
  1. Encrypt the input file and generate an encrypted file (`encrypted_example.txt`).  
  2. Decrypt the encrypted file and create a decrypted file (`decrypted_example.txt`).  
  3. Perform multi-threaded encryption and decryption of additional files if specified.  

---

#### **7. Code Structure/Components**  
- **`FileProcessor`**: Abstract class for processing files with encryption/decryption.  
- **`Encryptor`**: Encrypts files using AES with a secure IV.  
- **`Decryptor`**: Decrypts encrypted files back to their original form.  
- **`CryptoUtils`**: Provides utility methods for salt generation and key derivation.  
- **`MultiThreadProcessor`**: Handles concurrent processing of files using multiple threads.  
- **`Main`**: Demonstrates the programâ€™s functionality, including encryption, decryption, and multi-threaded file processing.
